# VirtualSkier
a tiny skiing-animation bot for Virtual RC

### Getting Started
If you're here because you want help using ActionCable in Python, the example.py script is a barebones template to get you started. I also threw together Getting_Started.md, to hopefully prevent others from making the embasarringly obvious mistakes that I did.

#### Why does the ski lodge in Virtual RC say it is currently closed?
Because I haven't set it up on a server to run all the time. But lucky you, here it is available on github for RC'ers to clone and build on! Or just ping me on Zulip and I'll run it. Watching the little skiier hop around makes me laugh. :)

### Mountain Rescue Patrol needed!
Do you think Virtual RC needs more adorable seasonal-themed emoji bots? Me too! Here's how you can make this project better:
* Implement the mysterious Skier2 to run concurrently with Skier1
* Fix the timezone discrepancy with much prettier code - 'sent_at' values from Virtual RC are in UTC, my local time is EST, the conversion is hideous!
* Expand the mountain/re-draw more ski paths than just 'down and to the left'
* Give helpful code review so I can learn to write and organize my code better
* Add something completely new I haven't thought of - get in touch on Zulip and let's plan it
